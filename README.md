These records are about the NFL players and their arrest history that was done before and during their career. How the system work is by having to select the player(s) from the team they are currently or previously stayed with. Once, the selected player(s) are found, the system will now communicate with the seperate database API to retrieve criminal data records of the players.

It will display the NFL player's records in simple format for the user to read it with little to no problems while reading.

While it will be the goal for the project to aim for, the current status of it running depends on the user's interest to build it from the early state. Also, the API to retrieve the Criminal data records is not fully operational yet since it is going back and forth on working and not when being requested from the website.
